    Resolves the absolute path for resources, considering whether the application is bundled with PyInstaller.

    This function adjusts the path resolution depending on whether the code is running in a PyInstaller bundle

    Parameters
    ----------
    relative_path : str
        The relative path to the resource within the application directory.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The absolute path to the resource, adjusted for the applicationâ€™s running context (bundled or development).
